# /rforge:capture - Quick Task Capture

Quickly capture ideas, tasks, and TODOs with automatic context detection.

## What It Does

Uses the `rforge_capture` MCP tool to:
- Capture tasks to .STATUS file
- Auto-detect context (which package)
- Add metadata (timestamp, status)
- Trigger doc cascade detection
- Organize by priority

## Usage

```bash
# Capture a task
/rforge:capture "Add bootstrap confidence intervals"

# Capture with priority
/rforge:capture "Fix bug #234" --priority high

# Capture idea
/rforge:capture "Research weighted mediation"
```

## Output

Returns confirmation with:
- **Task ID**: Unique identifier
- **Location**: Which .STATUS file
- **Context**: Detected package/project
- **Priority**: Auto-assigned or manual
- **Next Steps**: Suggested actions
